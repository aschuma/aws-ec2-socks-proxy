Sometimes, it is necessary to browse the Internet with privacy,
access content that is restricted by geography.
A VPN can help achieve this, but it requires either installing client software or subscribing
to a VPN service.

A more straightforward alternative is to use an encrypted SOCKS
proxy tunnel, which allows you to route your local network traffic
securely. When you use this proxy in your browser, the browser connects 
to an SSH server, which then forwards the traffic to its intended 
destination. As a result, third parties are unable to monitor your traffic 
or restrict access to websites because they are unaware of the 
browser's true location.

This can be achieved as follows.

* Set up an EC2 instance on AWS in the region where you wish to access GeoIP protected content.
* Establish a secure SSH tunnel from your local machine to the EC2 instance, forwarding traffic on port 4444. The
  following SSH command is used to configure a SOCKS proxy on the local server, which forwards all traffic to the EC2
  instance.

      ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -C -N -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ec2-user@18.133.223.240 -D 4444 

    * In this scenario, the EC2 instance is located at IP address `18.133.223.240`.
    * The SSH key being used is located at `~/.ssh/id_rsa` on the local machine.
    * On the local machine, the SOCKS proxy has been set up to listen on port `4444`.
* As a final step, configure your browser to use `localhost:4444` as the SOCKS proxy. Voila!

## Content of this repository

This repository holds two Python scripts that set up an AWS EC2 instance and tear down the instance.

The first script will perform the following tasks:

* Install a public key in the AWS region.
* Configure a security group.
* Launch a Nano EC2 instance using the public key and security group provided in the previous step.
* Output an ssh command to start the SOCKS proxy.

The purpose of the second script is to shut down the EC2 instance.

## Disclaimer

***Please note that these scripts come with absolutely no guarantees, and you use them at your own risk. Running this code may result in charges to your AWS account.***

## Preconditions

To proceed, you need an AWS account and must have your default credentials configured as described in the [AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and
Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/creds-config-files.html).

You will need an SSH key. To generate one, use the `ssh-keygen` command. You can easily find a tutorial online to learn how to use it.

Additionally, Python 3 must be installed on your machine.

## Setup

The steps to use this repository are as follows:

* Clone the project
* Change directory into the cloned project by using the `cd` command.
* Copy `env.py_template` to `env.py` and update the values for the SSH key name and AWS region in the newly created
  file.
* Create a virtual Python environment: `python3 -m venv`.
* Install the requirements: `pip install requirements.txt`.
* Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
* Run `START.py`, which will start the EC2 instance. The script will provide an SSH command, which you should execute to
  start the SOCKS tunnel.
* Configure your browser to use `localhost:4444` as the SOCKS proxy. Please refer to the browser's documentation to learn how to do this.

You can now browse the web in your selected region without GeoIP restrictions.

To shut down the EC2 instance, simply run the `STOP.py` script.
